# DebugKit
A drop-in UIView extension for debugging views

## How to use
Copy UIView+DebugKit.swift into your project. In `viewDidLoad`, add `view.inspectWithTap()` if you want to activate the menu by tapping on the view. If you want to activate the menu by long press, use `inspectWithLongPress()`

## Sample screens
After adding the line of code and running the project, a menu appears when the view is tapped or long pressed.
